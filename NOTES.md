### Avenues for coming up with an idea 
  * What problem do you have in everyday life you want to solve? 
  * What am I passionate about?

### Step 2: Working on the Overview 
  * Brainstorm about what kind of features you would like to have, write them down as you think of it, example: 

  EX: We would like to make an app that you create recipes, list/edit recipes, and can delete recipes. 
  A user should be able to fill out the form where you can create a recipe with instructions on how to create and add ingredients. A user can also list out recipes or like and comment on them. A user can delete their own recipes and edit their own recipes as well. 

### Step 3: List out all of the features
  * Form to create recipes (submit)
  * List out recipes (DOMContentLoaded)
  * A user can like a recipe (click)
  * A user can comment on a recipe (submit) //QOL
  * A user can delete their recipe (click) 
  * A user can edit their recipes (submit) //quality of life update 
  * A user can search their recipes (submit) //QOL

### Step 4: Come up with an MVP
  * Form to create recipe (submit)
  * List out recipe (DOMContentLoaded)
  * A user can delete their recipe (click)

### Step 5: Listing stretch goals 
  * A user can edit their recipes (submit)
  * A user can search their recipes (submit)
  * A user can like a recipe (click)
